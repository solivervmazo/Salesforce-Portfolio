# Part 1: Creating Portfolio Site in Salesforce Experience Cloud

In this project series, we will use my [Portfolio](https://solivervmazo.github.io/solivermazo/). as inspiration for design. We'll utilize Tailwind CSS, Lightning Web Components (LWC), Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to replicate the design aesthetics as much as possible.

All resources and latest output for this series is in `integration` branch.

### All parts of the series.
